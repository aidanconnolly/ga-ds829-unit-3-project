## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter Code | Project Description | [Here](./linreg-knn-project.ipynb) |
| Solution Code | Sample solutions for project questions | [Here](./Solution-Code/linreg-knn-project-solution.ipynb) |


> Note: Instructors should withold providing project solutions until students have submitted their drafts. In order to do so, avoid forking this repo and instead clone down materials locally, create a new repository in your student org, and upload materials manually.

## Project Objective

In this project, you'll build a linear regression model and a KNN model from scratch, via guided prompts. You will be exposed to model validation using the train/test split and K-Fold methods.

---

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the questions above.

Your notebook should include:

1.
2.
3.

---

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. 

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_

Additionally, instructors will provide feedback on required portions of your project.

## Submission

Your instructor will explain how to submit your assignment. Typically, this is done either by:

- Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor.
[or]
- Forking the project repository, adding your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the relevant repo.
